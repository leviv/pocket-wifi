          <h2>On Aaron Bushnell's Action in Solidarity with Gaza</h2>
          <h3>Published in <i>CrimethInc.</i> on February 26, 2024</h3>

          <br />

          <p>
            On Sunday, February 25, we received an email from a person who
            signed himself Aaron Bushnell.
          </p>

          <p>It read,</p>

          <blockquote>
            Today, I am planning to engage in an extreme act of protest against
            the genocide of the Palestinian people. The below links should take
            you to a livestream and recorded footage of the event, which will be
            highly disturbing. I ask that you make sure that the footage is
            preserved and reported on.
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            We consulted the Twitch account. The username displayed was
            "LillyAnarKitty," and the user icon was a circle A, the universal
            signifier for anarchism-the movement against all forms of domination
            and oppression.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the video, Aaron begins by introducing himself. "My name is Aaron
            Bushnell. I am an active-duty member of the US Air Force and I will
            no longer be complicit in genocide. I'm about to engage in an
            extreme act of protest-but compared to what people have been
            experiencing in Palestine at the hands of their colonizers, it's not
            extreme at all. This is what our ruling class has decided will be
            normal."
          </p>
          <p>
            The video shows Aaron continuing to film as he walks to the gate of
            the Israeli embassy in Washington, DC, puts down the phone, douses
            himself in a flammable liquid, and sets himself alight, shouting
            "Free Palestine" several times. After he collapses, police officers
            who had been watching the situation unfold run into the frame-one
            with a fire extinguisher, another with a gun. The officer continues
            pointing the gun at Aaron for over thirty seconds as Aaron lies on
            the ground, burning.
          </p>

          <p>
            Afterwards, police announced that they had called in their Explosive
            Ordinance Disposal Unit, though there were no explosives on site.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have since confirmed the identity of Aaron Bushnell. He served in
            the United States Air Force for almost four years. One of his loved
            ones described Aaron to us as "a force of joy in our community." An
            online post described him as "an amazingly gentle, kind,
            compassionate person who spends every minute and penny he has
            helping others. He is silly, makes anyone laugh, and wouldn't hurt a
            fly. He is a principled anarchist who lives out his values in
            everything he does."
          </p>
          <p>
            Aaron's friends tell us that he has passed away as a consequence of
            his injuries.
          </p>
          <p>
            All afternoon, while other journalists were breaking the news, we
            discussed how we should speak about this. Some subjects are too
            complex to address in a hasty social media post.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scale of the tragedy that is taking place in Gaza is
            heartrending. It exceeds anything we can understand from the vantage
            point of the United States. Over 30,000 Palestinians have been
            killed, including over 12,000 children. More than half of all
            inhabitable buildings in all of Gaza have been destroyed, along with
            the majority of hospitals. The vast majority of the population are
            living as refugees with little access to water, food, or shelter.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Israeli military is now planning a ground invasion of Rafah that
            will add untold numbers of casualties to this toll. It is not
            hyperbole to say that we are witnessing the deliberate commission of
            genocide. All available evidence indicates that the Israeli military
            will continue killing Palestinians by the thousand until they are
            forced to stop. And the longer this bloodshed goes on, the more
            people will die in the future, as other governments and groups
            imitate the precedent set by the Israeli government.
          </p>
          <p>
            The United States government bears equal responsibility in this
            tragedy, having armed and financed Israel and provided it with
            impunity in the sphere of international relations. Within Israel,
            the authorities have effectively suppressed protest movements in
            solidarity with Gaza. If protests are going to exert leverage
            towards stopping the genocide, it is up to people in the United
            States to figure out how to accomplish that.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what will it take? Thousands across the country have engaged in
            brave acts of protest without yet succeeding in putting a halt to
            Israel's assault.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aaron Bushnell was one of those who empathized with the Palestinians
            suffering and dying in Gaza, one of those haunted by the question of
            what our responsibilities are when we are confronted with such a
            tragedy. In this regard, he was exemplary. We honor his desire not
            to stand by passively in the face of atrocity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The death of a person in the United States should not be considered
            any more tragic-or more newsworthy-than the death of a single
            Palestinian. Still, there is more to say about his decision.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <p>
            Aaron was the second person to self-immolate at an Israeli
            diplomatic institution in the United States. Another demonstrator
            did the same thing at the Israeli consulate in Atlanta on December
            1, 2023. It is not easy for us to know how to speak about their
            deaths.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some journalists see themselves as engaged in the neutral activity
            of spreading information as an end in itself-as if the process of
            selecting what to spread and how to frame it could ever be neutral.
            For our part, when we speak, we presume that we are speaking to
            people of action, people like ourselves who are aware of their
            agency and are in the process of deciding what to do, people who may
            be wrestling with heartache and despair.
          </p>
          <p>
            Human beings influence each other both through rational argument and
            through the infectiousness of action. As Peter Kropotkin put it,
            "Courage, devotion, the spirit of sacrifice are as contagious as
            cowardice, submission, and panic."
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as we have a responsibility not to show cowardice, we also have
            a responsibility not to promote sacrifice casually. We must not
            speak carelessly about taking risks, even risks that we have taken
            ourselves. It is one thing to expose oneself to risk; it is another
            thing to invite others to run risks, not knowing what the
            consequences might be for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            And here, we are not speaking about a risk, but about the worst of
            all certainties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's not glamorize the decision to end one's life, nor celebrate
            anything with such permanent repercussions. Rather than exalting
            Aaron as a martyr and encouraging others to emulate him, we honor
            his memory, but we exhort you to take a different path.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            "This is what our ruling class has decided will be normal."
          </blockquote>
          <p>These words of Aaron's haunt us.</p>
          <p>
            He is right. We are rapidly entering an era in which human life is
            treated as worthless. This is obvious in Gaza, but we can see it
            elsewhere around the world, as well. With wars proliferating around
            the Mideast and North Africa, we are poised on the threshold of a
            new age of genocides. Even inside the United States, mass casualty
            incidents have become routine, while an entire segment of the
            underclass is consigned to addiction, homelessness, and death.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a tactic, self-immolation expresses a logic similar to the
            premise of the hunger strike. The protester treats himself or
            herself as a hostage, attempting to use his or her willingness to
            die to pressure the authorities. This strategy presumes that the
            authorities are concerned with the protester's well-being in the
            first place. Today, however, as we wrote in regards to the hunger
            strike of Alfredo Cospito,
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            No one should have any illusions about how governments view the
            sanctity of life in the age of COVID-19, when the United States
            government can countenance the deaths of a million people without
            blushing while the Russian government explicitly employs convicts as
            cannon fodder. The newly-elected fascist politicians who govern
            Italy have no scruples about consigning whole populations to death,
            let alone permitting a single anarchist to die.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            In this case, Aaron was not an imprisoned anarchist, but an
            active-duty member of the US military. His linkedin profile
            specifies that he graduated from basic training "top of flight and
            top of class." Will this make any difference to the US government?
          </p>
          <p>
            If nothing else, Aaron's action shows that genocide cannot take
            place overseas without collateral damage on this side of the ocean.
            Unfortunately, the authorities have never been especially moved by
            the deaths of US military personnel. Countless US veterans have
            struggled with addiction and homelessness since returning from Iraq
            and Afghanistan. Veterans commit suicide at a much higher rate than
            all other adults. The US military continues to use weapons that
            expose US troops to permanent brain injuries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Members of the military are taught to understand their willingness
            to die as the chief resource they have to put at the service of the
            things they believe in. In many cases, this way of thinking is
            passed down intergenerationally. At the same time, the ruling class
            takes the deaths of soldiers in stride. This is what they have
            decided will be normal.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not willingness to die that will sway our rulers. They really
            fear our lives, not our deaths-they fear our willingness to act
            collectively according to a different logic, actively interrupting
            their order.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many things that are worth doing entail risks, but choosing to
            intentionally end your life means foreclosing years or decades of
            possibility, denying the rest of us a future with you. If such a
            decision is ever appropriate, it is only when every other possible
            course of action has been exhausted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Uncertainty is one of the most difficult things for human beings to
            bear. There is a tendency to seek to resolve it as quickly as
            possible, even by imposing the worst-case scenario in advance-even
            if that means choosing death. There is a sort of relief in knowing
            how things will turn out. Too often, despair and self-sacrifice
            mingle and blur together, offering an all-too-simple escape from
            tragedies that appear unsolvable.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your heart is broken by the horrors in Gaza and you are prepared
            to bear significant consequences to try to stop them, we urge you to
            do everything in your power to find comrades and make plans
            collectively. Lay the foundations for a full life of resistance to
            colonialism and all forms of oppression. Prepare to take risks as
            your conscience demands, but don't hurry towards self-destruction.
            We desperately need you alive, at our side, for all that is to come.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we wrote in 2011 in reference to the self-immolation of Mohamed
            Bouazizi,
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Nothing is more terrifying than departing from what we know. It may
            take more courage to do this without killing oneself than it does to
            light oneself on fire. Such courage is easier to find in company;
            there is so much we can do together that we cannot do as
            individuals. If he had been able to participate in a powerful social
            movement, perhaps Bouazizi would never have committed suicide; but
            paradoxically, for such a thing to be possible, each of us has to
            take a step analogous to the one he took into the void.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Let's admit that the kind of protest activity that has taken place
            thus far in the United States has not served to compel the US
            government to compel a halt to the genocide in Gaza. It is an open
            question what could accomplish that. Aaron's action challenges us to
            answer this question-and to answer it differently than he did.
          </p>
          <p>We mourn his passing.</p>

            By now, you may have heard - possibly from the same people creating
            the technology - that artificial intelligence might one day kill us
            all. The specifics are hazy, but then, they don't really matter.
            Humans are very good at fantasizing about being exterminated by an
            alien species, because we've always been good at devising creative
            ways of doing it to our fellow creatures. AI could destroy humanity
            for something as stupid as, in philosopher Nick Bostrom's famous
            thought experiment, turning the world's matter into paper clips -
            much like humans are now wiping out our great ape cousins,
            orangutans, to cultivate palm oil to make junk foods like Oreos.
          </p>
          <p>
            You might even say that the human nightmare of subjugation by
            machines expresses a sublimated fear of our treatment of non-human
            animals being turned back on us. "We know what we've done," as
            journalist Ezra Klein put it on a May episode of his podcast. "And
            we wouldn't want to be on the other side of it."
          </p>
          <p>
            AI threatens the quality that many of us believe has made humans
            unique on this planet: intelligence. So, as author Meghan O'Gieblyn
            wrote in her book God, Human, Animal, Machine, "We quell our anxiety
            by insisting that what distinguishes true consciousness is emotions,
            perception, the ability to experience and feel: the qualities, in
            other words, that we share with animals." We tell ourselves, in
            other words, that even if AI may one day be smarter than us, unlike
            the machines, we have subjective experience, which makes us morally
            special.
          </p>
          <p>
            The obvious problem with this, though, is that humans aren't special
            in this way. Non-human animals share many of our capacities for
            intelligence and perception, yet we've refused to extend the
            generosity we might expect from AI. We rationalize unmitigated
            cruelty toward animals - caging, commodifying, mutilating, and
            killing them to suit our whims - on the basis of our purportedly
            superior intellect. "If there were gods, they would surely be
            laughing their heads off at the inconsistency of our logic,"
            O'Gieblyn continues. "We spent centuries denying consciousness in
            animals precisely because [we thought] they lacked reason or higher
            thought."
          </p>
          <p>
            Why should we hope that AI, particularly if it's built on our own
            values, treats us any differently? We might struggle to justify to a
            future artificial "superintelligence," if such a thing could ever
            exist, why we're deserving of mercy when we've failed spectacularly
            at offering our fellow animals the same. And, worse still, the
            dehumanizing philosophy of AI's prophets is among the worst possible
            starting points to defend the value of our fleshy, living selves.
          </p>
          <h2>Transhumanism is built on a hatred of animality</h2>
          <p>
            Although modern humans defend the exploitation of non-human animals
            in terms of their assumed lack of intelligence, this has never been
            the real reason for it. If we took that argument at face value and
            treated animals according to their smarts, we would immediately stop
            factory-farming octopuses, which can use tools, recognize human
            faces, and figure out how to escape enclosures. We wouldn't keep
            elephants in solitary confinement in zoos, recognizing it as a
            violation of their rights and needs as smart, caring, deeply social
            creatures. We wouldn't psychologically torture pigs by immobilizing
            them in cages so small they can't turn around, condemning them to a
            short lifetime essentially spent in a coffin, all to turn them into
            cheap cuts of bacon. We would realize that it's wholly unnecessary
            to subject intelligent cows to the trauma of repeated, human-induced
            pregnancies and separation from their newborns, just so we can drink
            the milk meant for their calves.
          </p>
          <p>
            In reality, we aren't cruel to animals because they're stupid; we
            say they're stupid because we're cruel to them, inventing fact-free
            mythologies about their minds to justify our dominance, as political
            theorist Dinesh Wadiwel lays this out in his brilliant 2015 book The
            War Against Animals. In a chapter called "The Violence of
            Stupidity," Wadiwel contends that human power over animals enables
            us to be willfully and unaccountably stupid about what they are
            really like. "How else might we describe a claimed superiority by
            humans over animals (whether based on intelligence, reason,
            communication, vocalisation, or politics) that has no consistent or
            verifiable â€˜scientific' or â€˜philosophical' basis?" he writes.
            Humans, like animals, are vulnerable, breakable creatures who can
            only thrive within a specific set of physical and social
            constraints. We can only hope that future AI, however intelligent,
            doesn't evince the same stupidity with respect to us.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we can only guess whether some powerful future AI will
            categorize us as unintelligent, what's clear is that there is an
            explicit and concerning contempt for the human animal among
            prominent AI boosters. AI research itself has strong ties to
            transhumanism, a movement that aims to radically alter and augment
            human bodies with technology. Its most extreme aspirants hope to
            merge humanity with computers, excising suffering from life like a
            tumor from a cancer patient and living in a state of everlasting
            bliss, as Bostrom, one of the main proponents of transhumanism, has
            suggested. Elon Musk, for instance, has said that he launched
            Neuralink, his brain-computer interface startup, in part so that
            humans can remain competitive in an intelligence arms race with AI.
            "Even under a benign AI, we will be left behind," Musk said at a
            Neuralink event in 2019. "With a high bandwidth brain-machine
            interface, we will have the option to go along for the ride."
          </p>
          <p>
            This aspiration can be interpreted as an implicit loathing of our
            animality, or at least a desire to liberate ourselves from it. "We
            will be the first species ever to design our own descendants,"
            technologist Sam Altman, now the CEO of OpenAI, wrote in a 2017 blog
            post. "My guess is that we can either be the biological bootloader
            for digital intelligence" - meaning just a stepping stone for
            advanced AI - "and then fade into an evolutionary tree branch, or we
            can figure out what a successful merge looks like."
          </p>
          <p>
            Computer scientist Danny Hillis, co-founder of the now-defunct AI
            company Thinking Machines, declared in the early '90s that humans
            are composed of two fundamentally different things: "We're the
            metabolic thing, which is the monkey that walks around, and we're
            the intelligent thing, which is a set of ideas and culture," as
            historian David Noble quotes in his 1997 book The Religion of
            Technology. "What's valuable about us," Hillis continued, "what's
            good about humans, is the idea thing. It's not the animal thing."
            Merging with computers signifies our extrication from animal
            biology.
          </p>
          <p>
            This human/animal dualism posits a clean cognitive break between us
            and the rest of the animal evolutionary tree, when in fact no such
            division exists. It relies on an implausible model of human
            intelligence as having nothing to do with our physical, animal
            selves: a notion that "the mind is computation, that it does not
            involve the affective dimensions of the human experience, and it
            doesn't involve the body," Michael Sacasas, a technology critic who
            writes The Convivial Society, a popular Substack, told me.
          </p>
          <p>
            The societal reckoning taking place now over where humans fit in a
            world of AI, might, as Sacasas hopes, prompt us to start to rethink
            this dualism, to recognize that the body is "not just as the
            firmware for the rational software, but actually an integral part of
            what we call â€˜mind.'" Breaking down that dualism ought to also mean
            giving up the separate status we assign ourselves as human beings.
            It could help us broaden the definition of intelligence itself to
            encompass the animal qualities described by O'Gieblyn - "emotions,
            perception, the ability to experience and feel." There is, after
            all, no single thing in our brains called "intelligence" or
            "thought"; it's not a body part, but an emergent property continuous
            with our other mental processes. Animals share these, and in some
            cases exceed them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Migratory birds, for example, can famously navigate by perceiving
            the Earth's magnetic field. Raccoons can "see" and learn about the
            world with their hyper-sensitive hands (this is why they can
            sometimes be seen enthusiastically patting objects and other
            animals). Pigs are undoubtedly smart, but the widely cited idea that
            they're "as smart as" 3-year-old children reflects the depressing
            way that we've come to measure intelligence against a
            single-variable, anthropocentric yardstick, rather than recognizing
            different beings as having different minds. Yet this is dehumanizing
            to us, too, because it judges our cognition as though it were a
            computer's CPU. If we can properly value animals' capacities, then
            we might also see how claiming human exceptionalism through a
            disembodied view of our minds has done spiritual harm to ourselves.
          </p>
          <h2>AI criticism ought to include non-human animals</h2>
          <p>
            You don't have to believe that AI could become autonomous and
            orchestrate our extinction to see how, for example, chatbots are
            already blurring the line between humans and machines, creating the
            illusion of sentience where it doesn't exist, a critique made by
            linguist Emily Bender. Others, like Sacasas, point to how AI
            replacing humans represents the culmination of modernity's drive to
            eliminate inefficiency from life. "By the logic of the market and of
            techno-capitalism, if you like, the inefficiencies of the human
            being were always ultimately meant to be disposed of," he said. "AI,
            in a sense, just kind of furthers that logic â€¦ and brings it to its
            logical conclusion, which is, you're just getting rid of people."
          </p>
          <p>
            These kinds of critiques ring true to me - yet they also have a way
            of fixating on the ethical and spiritual uniqueness of human beings,
            to the exclusion of the other sentient, intelligent creatures with
            whom we've always shared the planet. "One of the anxieties generated
            by AI is built upon how we have sought to distinguish the human, or
            to elevate the human, or to find the unique thing about the human,"
            Sacasas points out. Humans are, in important ways, obviously unique
            among animals. But the critical discourse about AI has shown little
            interest in thinking beyond ourselves, or reckoning with what
            implications this moment has for our undervaluing of animals.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the best-known critiques of AI large language models, or
            LLMs, for example, compares AI's lack of language understanding to
            that of an animal: the concept of the "stochastic parrot," which
            refers to how chatbots, not having minds, spit out language based on
            probabilistic models with no regard for meaning. "You are not a
            parrot," proclaimed the headline of a widely read March profile of
            Emily Bender in New York magazine.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm sure Bender has nothing against parrots - exceptionally smart
            animals that are thought to reproduce sounds with astonishing
            fidelity as part of their communication with one another and with
            humans. But parrots aren't machines, and imagining them as such only
            reinforces the human/animal dualism that gave us the disembodied
            view of our own minds. It's as if we have no language for affirming
            our worth as humans without repudiating animality.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ascendance of AI should be a pivotal moment from which to start
            to come to grips with our relationship to other sentient, biological
            life. If AI were ever in a position to make judgments about us, we
            should hope that it's far more charitable than we have been, that it
            doesn't nitpick, mock, or nullify our capacities and needs as we've
            done to other animals. If we wouldn't want to be tyrannized by a
            more powerful intelligence, we have no credible defense for
            continuing to do the same.
          </p>
          <h2>
            We don't know if sentient AI is possible, but if it is, we shouldn't
            build it
          </h2>
          <p>
            None of this necessarily tells us whether the machines themselves
            could ever become sentient, or how we should proceed if they can. I
            used to find the idea of sentient AI risible, but now I'm not so
            sure. The scientific method has not figured out how to explain
            consciousness, as O'Gieblyn points out. Modern science, she writes,
            "was predicated in the first place on the exclusion of the mind."
          </p>
          <p>
            If we don't know where consciousness comes from, we may want to be
            careful about assuming it can only arise from biological life,
            especially given our poor track record of appreciating it in
            animals. "Evolution was just selecting repeatedly on ability to have
            babies, and here we are. We have goals," as Vox's Kelsey Piper said
            on The Ezra Klein Show in March. "Why does that process get you
            things that have goals? I don't know."
          </p>
          <p>
            We have no reason to believe any current AIs are sentient, but we
            also have no way of knowing whether or how that could change. "We're
            kind of at the point where we can make fire but do not even have the
            rudiments of what we'd need to understand it," my friend Luke
            Gessler, a computational linguist, told me.
          </p>
          <p>
            If sentience in AI could ever emerge (a big if), I'm doubtful we'd
            be willing to recognize it, for the same reason that we've denied
            its existence in animals. Humans are very good at dismissing or
            lying about the interests of beings that we want to exploit
            (including not just animals but also, of course, enslaved humans,
            women, and any other class of people who have been excluded from
            moral consideration). Creating sentient AI would be unethical
            because we'd be bringing it into the world as chattel. Consigning
            sentient beings to property status, as we know from the experience
            of non-human animals, is inherently unjust because their welfare
            will always be subordinated to economic efficiency and the desires
            of their owners. "We will inevitably inflict suffering on them,"
            science fiction author Ted Chiang said of building sentient AI in
            2021. "That seems to me clearly a bad idea."
          </p>
          <p>
            In a May essay, Columbia philosopher Dhananjay Jagannathan offered a
            different perspective on the AI minds question. Drawing from
            Aristotle, he suggests that the nature of thought isn't something
            that can be scientifically deduced or implanted into a computer,
            because it's an irreducible part of our lives as biological animals.
            "Thinking is life," the Aristotelian idea puts it. A raccoon who
            pats things to learn about her environment, for example, or a baby
            bird who pecks around at objects to do the same, or a human whose
            sense of smell vividly triggers a distant memory are all having
            experiences of thinking that are inextricable from the biological
            organs through which they're engaging with the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            One upshot of this, Jagannathan writes, is that the transhumanist
            dream of digitally uploading our consciousness and splitting from
            our bodies, far from being any sort of liberation, amounts to
            "self-annihilation." The idea of thinking as inseparable from
            animality can be hard for modern people to comprehend because, as
            O'Gieblyn writes, our concept of the mind pulls so heavily from
            computational metaphors. Because we imagine our cognition as a
            computer, we start to imagine, erroneously, that computers can
            think.
          </p>
          <h2>
            AI evokes our anxieties about the fragility and mistreatment of
            animality
          </h2>
          <p>
            Jagannathan's view, that we can understand thought through our
            kinship with non-human animals, helps clarify what is disconcerting
            about the dualist, computational view of experience, taken to its
            logical endpoint by AI and transhumanist philosophy. The assumption
            that we can apprehend, measure, and perfect subjective experience,
            rendering life as though it were bits of information encoded on a
            computer, can lead to conclusions that are obviously repugnant. It
            has made the annihilation of biological life, both human and
            non-human, imaginable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prominent philosopher Will MacAskill, for example, proposed in his
            2022 book What We Owe the Future that declining populations of wild
            animals (we are, if you haven't heard, in the middle of a mass
            extinction) may actually be desirable. Their lives might be "worse
            than nothing on average, which I think is plausible (though
            uncertain)," he writes, because they may consist more of suffering,
            from things like predation and disease, than of pleasure. Perhaps,
            then, they'd be better off if they'd never been born - an argument
            that springs from the same well as the transhumanist impulse to
            remove suffering from life and colonize the universe with beings
            merged with machines.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea of wild animal eradication represents one of the more
            extreme manifestations of the drive to denude life of physical
            content. In a similar vein, transhumanist philosopher David Pearce,
            who sits on the board of the organization Herbivorize Predators (it
            aims to do what the name implies), hopes to technologically
            "eliminate all forms of unpleasant experience from human and
            non-human life, replacing suffering with â€˜information-sensitive
            gradients of bliss.'"
          </p>
          <p>
            In the actual world, where wild animals are often exterminated
            wholesale when their presence is inconvenient for us, the notion
            that it could actually be morally righteous to get rid of them might
            provide a justification for the ecocide that humans are engaged in
            anyway. Who's to say that an AI won't one day say the same thing
            about us, deciding that it's best to put us out of our misery based
            on its cold calculation of our pains and pleasures? That would be
            consistent with the transhumanist ethos of transcending the hardship
            of physical existence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet this dim estimation of our biological selves, as well as those
            of animals, forecloses the possibility of valuing or interpreting
            life in other ways. We can hardly access an animal's interiority,
            much less be able to say whether they think their lives are worth
            living. If a utilitarian bean counter told me that the rest of my
            life would be 70 percent suffering, I wouldn't choose to die, even
            if I truly believed them; I would want to live out my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            A very different, more integrated interpretation of animal life, one
            that I return to again and again, can be found in a work by the poet
            Alan Shapiro. His 2002 poem "Joy" gives expression to the strange
            entanglement of joy, fear, and tragedy that defines our lives, and,
            he imagines, perhaps those of wild animals also. "Joy," he writes,
            is the thing that is "Savagely beautiful," likening it to antelope
            evading a lion:
          </p>
          <p>
            This vision doesn't, to me, suggest that the suffering of wild
            animals doesn't matter, but rather that the vulnerable, mysterious
            fullness of their lives is worth living. AI evokes our anxieties
            about the fragility and mistreatment of animality - our own, as well
            as that of nonhuman animals. It reminds us of our own vulnerability,
            the parts of us that are unfathomable or expendable in mechanistic
            terms. In a world where the ability to manipulate language is no
            longer a uniquely human capacity, the rationalizing impulse might
            ask us to co-sign our own obsolescence. We might, instead, decide
            that our creaturely selves are worth holding on to, and, in doing
            so, invite our fellow animals into our moral circle.

            A boy's death launches a movement to end pedestrian and cyclist
            fatalities in New York City and beyond.
          </h2>
          <h3>
            Published in <i>The New Yorker</i> by Danyoung Kim on June 2, 2022
          </h3>

          <p>
            On the afternoon of October 8, 2013, in the last moments of his
            life, twelve-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, of Park Slope, Brooklyn,
            was walking to after-school soccer practice near his apartment on
            Prospect Park West when he lost control of his ball. It rolled into
            the busy southbound street, and he went after it. The driver of a
            car in one lane hit the brakes. The driver of a van in the next lane
            did not. Later, he said he'd seen only a ball, not a boy.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Sammy didn't yet have his growth spurt," his mother, Amy Cohen,
            said. "He was small for his age. This is why he didn't survive."
            Apart from the funeral, to which nearly a thousand people came, she
            spent the following days under the covers, as her husband, Gary
            Eckstein, took the lead in caring for Sammy's devastated older
            sister, Tamar. Their son had been a popular figure in the
            neighborhood, game to debate climate change and Yankees pitching
            with all comers. A random accident-that's what people told them.
            Sleepless, Amy began to wonder how random Sammy's death really was.
            Not long after shiva ended, she forced herself to walk to the corner
            where Sammy had been killed, which had also been a corner where he'd
            grown up playing. Raising a radar gun borrowed from a neighbor, she
            aimed toward Prospect Park West.
          </p>
          <p>
            Drivers on this street go too fast, she used to warn the children.
            Now, at a little past 5 p.m., the hour her son was killed, she
            tracked just how fast, recording her findings on a legal pad. Almost
            no driver kept to the thirty-mile-an-hour speed limit. Sometimes
            they went over forty. By chance, the City Council's transportation
            committee would soon be holding a hearing about a bill to cut the
            speed limit in residential neighborhoods to twenty miles per hour.
            Amy, Gary, and Tamar had decided to testify, and Amy wanted to bring
            hard evidence along with her grief.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the hearing, after Amy and Gary presented data they'd gathered,
            Tamar, then fifteen, was the last to speak. She read a letter that
            she had written to her brother after his death: "At camp this
            summer, for the first time in our lives, we were separated for four
            weeks. It was really hard. I kept expecting you to be there, and you
            weren't." She took shallow breaths and read quickly, with little
            inflection. "Now I am going to have to live my whole life like
            that." The transportation committee tended to be skeptical of
            measures that inconvenienced drivers. But, when Tamar spoke, the
            city councilman Brad Lander, who represented the Park Slope area,
            recalled, "You could feel the change in that hearing." Several
            council members wept, among them James Vacca, the chairman of the
            committee, who said, "I'm going to remember this day for as long as
            I live." But tears didn't magically change the speed limits. The
            bill was tabled, representatives moved on to other topics, and the
            Cohen Ecksteins retreated back home.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few days later, though, Amy's phone rang, and on the other end was
            Caroline Samponaro, who had heard about the family's testimonies.
            Samponaro was, at the time, the deputy director of a nonprofit
            called Transportation Alternatives, which sought to make New York
            City streets friendlier to non-drivers. Samponaro asked if her group
            could assist Amy's family, perhaps by connecting them to legal
            counsel. Right away, Amy grasped that what she needed instead was
            the company of other families who could understand what hers had
            lost. In the fog of the early mourning days, another mother, Amy
            Tam-Liao, had called her to say that, two days before Sammy's death,
            her three-year-old daughter, Allison, had been killed by a man
            driving an S.U.V. in Flushing, Queens. That weekend, Tam-Liao and
            her husband, Hsi-Pei, visited the Cohen Ecksteins, and the parents
            found comfort-small but not nothing-in telling one another that
            their children's deaths had not been their fault.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Amy's suggestion, Transportation Alternatives staff members
            compiled a list of grieving families they had worked with in the
            past, and over the next three months Amy made her way down it. She
            talked to Mary Beth Kelly, whose husband, Henry, was killed in
            Chelsea by a man driving a police tow truck as they were biking
            home; to Dave Shephard, whose fiancÃ©e, Sonya Powell, was killed in
            the Bronx as they walked across the street; to the Gansons, whose
            lives were upended when Hutch Ganson was run over as he walked one
            of his daughters to the subway; to Anna Kovel and Greg Merryweather,
            whose nine-year-old son, Lucian, was killed by the driver of an
            S.U.V. in Fort Greene a month after Sammy died. In February, 2014,
            more than twenty people who had lost family members to traffic
            violence gathered for the first time at the Chelsea office of Good
            Shepherd Services, a nonprofit where Amy Cohen worked as an
            administrator.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            One attendee was Dana Lerner, whose nine-year-old son, Cooper Stock,
            had been run over and killed four weeks earlier outside the family's
            apartment on the Upper West Side. "I was in a state of agony. I
            could barely stand up," she told me. "I went into this meeting and
            people started hugging me, and I realized, Oh, my God. There are
            other people." Debbie Kahn, whose only child, Seth, was killed while
            walking with the right-of-way in Hell's Kitchen, said, "It was like
            we found our home."
          </p>
          <p>
            At long tables in a drab conference room, the families began to
            talk, and quickly they saw that what they could take from one
            another went beyond emotional support. Individually, several had
            come to a realization not unlike one Amy had after her testimony at
            the City Council hearing: that challenging the status quo of traffic
            deaths required people working in concert. At their second meeting,
            those whom Amy brought together would name themselves Families for
            Safe Streets, positioning their fledgling organization against an
            epidemic that most Americans don't see.
          </p>

            In the nineteen-tens, when cars were becoming commonplace in the
            United States, their right to dominate the road was fiercely
            contested. Newspapers ran articles denouncing drivers for hitting
            pedestrians, and police sometimes had to rescue such drivers from
            mobs baying for blood. During the following decade, the number of
            fatalities per year doubled, reaching thirty thousand in 1929. There
            were no driving tests, lane markings, traffic lights, or stop signs
            on streets, which had long been public spaces where children played.
            Drunk adults drove. Children drove, too. Cars killed thirteen
            hundred people in New York alone in 1929-still a record for the
            city. The majority of victims in New York City, then as now, were
            pedestrians. Grassroots protest movements coalesced, their leaders
            arguing that the speed and power of cars foretold a public-health
            crisis-a point driven home by posters of mothers holding lifeless
            children. But the automotive industry had a better-funded
            counter-campaign to make high body counts acceptable to the public.

            As the historian Peter Norton writes in his book "Fighting Traffic,"
            starting in the nineteen-twenties, the National Automobile Chamber
            of Commerce, the leading lobbying group for car manufacturers,
            persuaded editors to publish its pseudo-statistical "news reports"
            on car crashes, which spread the idea that "jaywalkers"-a pejorative
            for people from rural areas who didn't know how to navigate city
            streets-were responsible for their own injuries and deaths. Auto
            clubs sponsored street shows in which jaywalkers were lampooned by
            clowns and convicted in mock trials held by children. This industry
            campaign helped to bring about what Norton calls a "social
            reconstruction of the street," in which pedestrians were taught to
            accommodate cars, not the other way around. A new school of urban
            designers, called highway engineers, refashioned cities to push
            pedestrians and cyclists further to the margins. Meanwhile, media
            coverage of car crashes grew less critical of drivers, and a sense
            of fatalism began to envelop the consequences of traffic collisions,
            which are typically called "accidents," suggesting that no one is to
            blame and nothing can be changed. (Plane crashes are not described
            in the same way.) By century's end, cars had grown progressively
            larger, better insulated from the feedback of the surrounding
            environment, and safer for the people inside them. Those on the
            outside were less lucky. The U.S. automotive lobby resisted
            regulations enacted in Europe that made cars and trucks less lethal,
            and, by 2018, the number of pedestrian and cyclist deaths per
            kilometre in the United States was more than four times higher than
            in the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Among the most
            vulnerable are older adults, who in 2020 made up twenty per cent of
            killed pedestrians, and people who live in low-income neighborhoods
            where there has been little investment in safe road design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between 2010 and 2019, as the number of U.S. drivers or passengers
            who died in collisions held fairly steady, deaths of those on foot
            and on bikes rose by forty-six per cent and thirty-eight per cent,
            respectively.

            In the months after Sammy died, Amy Cohen learned that other people
            in her co-op could handle the recycling pickup for the building,
            that long walks helped, that chatter about other children's
            high-school-admissions anxieties didn't. She also learned the
            correlation between car speed and survival. The average pedestrian,
            if struck by a car moving at forty miles per hour, has about a
            fifty-per-cent chance of survival. If the car is going twenty miles
            per hour, the pedestrian has more than a ninety-per-cent chance. Had
            the van that hit Sammy been moving just a little bit more slowly,
            Amy believed, her son might still be alive.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1997, Sweden's parliament encoded this connection between speed
            and mortality in a groundbreaking package of legislation called
            Vision Zero, whose reforms promised to save lives by slowing down
            traffic. At the time, Sweden already had one of the world's lowest
            per-capita traffic-death rates, but among Vision Zero's premises
            were that any death as a cost of transportation is unacceptable;
            that drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians are fallible; and that
            street design should lessen the consequences of human error. Before
            long, Sweden's traffic deaths were halved, and leaders elsewhere in
            the world were paying attention. As 2014 began, Amy joined other
            street-safety advocates in lobbying to bring Vision Zero laws to New
            York City. That February, the newly elected mayor of New York, Bill
            de Blasio, became one of the first U.S. municipal leaders to take
            what's become known as the Vision Zero pledge. The pledge commits a
            city's leaders to policies aimed at eliminating traffic fatalities
            and serious injuries within a certain time frame-in New York City,
            by 2024. Fifty-one other local governments have since joined Vision
            Zero.

            Serious street redesign is not cheap. According to the city's
            Independent Budget Office, the de Blasio administration, in the
            first six years of Vision Zero, spent an average of a hundred and
            ninety million dollars per year on road redesign. But the payoff was
            a drop in the death toll. In 2018, two hundred and six people were
            killed in traffic, a record low for New York City. Then de Blasio's
            commitment waned, covid-19 broke out, and progress stalled. In 2021,
            a banner year for cycling in New York City and elsewhere, two
            hundred and seventy-three people died-fourteen more than in the year
            Vision Zero was adopted.

            In early meetings of Families for Safe Streets, Amy Cohen and the
            others recognized that their losses bestowed upon them a bleak kind
            of narrative power, and they thought carefully about how to use it.
            The prospect of performing their grief publicly was brutal. But, in
            similar movements-among them Amsterdam's Stop de Kindermoord (Stop
            Killing Children) campaign of the seventies, which turned that city
            into a bike idyll-mothers, bearing an anguish poignant to the
            public, had proved effective as victims. After some discussion,
            F.S.S. members decided that their first fight would be to lower New
            York City's default speed limit from thirty miles per hour to
            twenty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reducing that speed limit first required a change in state law-a
            challenge in New York, where, as in many other states, leaders have
            long prioritized the swift movement of cars and trucks over
            pedestrian and cyclist safety. In the spring of 2014, Amy and the
            other F.S.S. members began making trips to Albany to lobby state
            legislators, carrying smiling photos of their lost ones and wearing
            matching T-shirts with the name of their new group. Transportation
            Alternatives staff had trained them in public speaking, but the
            officials they met, some receptive and some not, cautioned that
            changing laws usually took years. As infuriating as Amy and her
            colleagues found this lack of urgency, they ultimately
            accepted-bitterly-that a twenty-mile-per-hour default speed limit
            wouldn't happen that year. A compromise of twenty-five miles per
            hour found a crucial ally in Sheldon Silver, then the speaker of the
            Assembly. In a meeting with Amy and her colleagues, he confided that
            he had lost his mother in a car crash. In June, four months after
            F.S.S. started campaigning, both chambers of the state legislature
            voted in favor of a bill that ultimately slowed down thousands of
            miles of New York City streets.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            The bill-signing ceremony took place in a sparsely decorated hall in
            the Javits Center. Aaron Charlop-Powers, a twenty-nine-year-old
            who'd thrown a blazer over his F.S.S. T-shirt, spoke on the group's
            behalf. One reason he had been picked to be at the podium was that
            he could usually tell his story without breaking down. In 2010, a
            bus in the Bronx had hit and killed his mother, Megan Charlop, a
            community organizer. "Failure is waiting for someone to be killed to
            reduce the speed limit or redesign the intersection. Failure is my
            mother being run over and the bike lane being painted on the street
            a week after," he said, adding, "We hope you never join our group."

          <p>
            More members kept coming, though, among them the mother of Mathieu
            Lefevre, a thirty-year-old cyclist who was killed at an intersection
            in Williamsburg by the driver of a crane truck. An officer told the
            media that Lefevre had run a red light. Video that later emerged
            showed the driver turning into Lefevre's path without signalling,
            slamming into him, and dragging him across the intersection. The
            driver was not charged. Dan Hanegby, also in his thirties, was
            fatally run over on his bike by the driver of a bus running parallel
            to him in Chelsea in 2017. Police told reporters that he had
            "swerved" into the bus. Surveillance footage from a nearby store
            showed nothing of the kind. Amy started working with Hanegby's wife.
            In 2019, Mario Valenzuela, a fourteen-year-old, was killed in Long
            Island City when a truck driver overtook his bicycle and veered in
            front of him. Police inspectors obtained video showing that the boy
            had the right-of-way; nonetheless, they attributed the cause of the
            crash to "cyclist error." The Valenzuela family joined F.S.S.

            Aaron Naparstek, a journalist who has meticulously investigated such
            wrongful deaths for Streetsblog, a transportation-focussed Web site
            that he founded in 2006, notes a chilling consistency in New York
            City pedestrian and cyclist fatalities: police investigators rarely
            conduct interviews with anyone other than the drivers and passengers
            of vehicles. Victims on foot or on a bicycle are often in no
            condition to provide statements about what happened, and evidence
            that might challenge drivers' accounts goes uncollected. Steve
            Vaccaro, a personal-injury attorney, said, "If there's video of the
            crash, it gets overwritten. If there are skid marks, they're washed
            away. If there are eyewitnesses, they disperse and can't be found
            again." Many victims' families lack the resources to track down
            video footage, conduct their own investigations, hire lawyers, or
            otherwise redress the narrative asymmetry. Predictably, the dead are
            the ones who get blamed. "Nobody ever looks at the car as a weapon,"
            Naparstek said. "The basic rule that I discovered over the years is
            if you ever want to murder someone in New York City, do it with a
            car."

            Street-safety advocates call the tendency to sympathize with drivers
            "windshield bias"-a predisposition that Tara Goddard, an
            urban-planning professor at Texas A. & M. University, noted has deep
            roots in American life. "The way we've set up our society and our
            land use and transportation systems, it's very difficult to get by
            in the U.S. without a car," she said. "So, even if it's unsafe on an
            aggregate level, and even if you don't enjoy day-to-day travelling
            and being stuck in traffic, it's still the best of bad options.
            Subconsciously, we have to justify what we're doing to tolerate it."

            Eric Gonzalez, the Brooklyn District Attorney, has long been
            interested in how the justice system can help prevent car
            fatalities. He believes that police officers are too ready to
            imagine that they could have been the driver in a collision with a
            pedestrian or cyclist. Yet, even when investigations are rigorous,
            less than two per cent of city crashes in which the drivers are
            sober result in criminal charges-despite a law on the books in New
            York City for the past eight years that makes killing or injuring a
            pedestrian or cyclist who has the right-of-way a criminal
            misdemeanor. Gonzalez blames a prevailing legal standard that
            prevents drivers who hurt or kill someone from being held criminally
            liable unless they've made at least two mistakes, such as being
            distracted and driving through a red light, or texting and speeding.
            And, even when this rule of two is met or exceeded, claims tend to
            be civil. "The way the law has developed," Gonzalez says, "even when
            a driver is extraordinarily reckless, the courts have said you can't
            attach a criminal mens rea to the conduct."

            Today, fifty-five per cent of New York City pedestrians killed are
            hit at intersections. Amy Tam-Liao's three-year-old daughter,
            Allison, was one of them. After Allison died, the police secured
            dashcam video showing her and her grandmother stepping hand in hand
            into the crosswalk with the right-of-way. The police issued two
            traffic tickets to the driver who killed Allison, Ahmad Abu-Zayedeh,
            but he later contested them at the New York State Department of
            Motor Vehicles. An administrative judge threw out the tickets in a
            proceeding that lasted less than a minute. Families of victims are
            not included in such hearings, and the fact that a girl, exuberant
            and beloved, had died under the tire of the driver never came up.
          </p>
          <hr />

            The single chance that most families have to participate in a
            government inquiry about what happened to the person they have lost
            comes at what is called a D.M.V. fatality hearing: a bureaucratic
            reckoning of the circumstances and the conduct of the driver. But
            many F.S.S. members say they were never notified of their family
            members' hearings. Amy Cohen was determined not to miss Sammy's,
            and, having attended other such hearings with F.S.S. colleagues,
            supposed she was better prepared than most for the distressing event
            when the day arrived, twenty months after he died. But that June
            morning, seated at a small table in a cramped conference room at the
            Manhattan D.M.V. office, she had to steel herself to look into the
            face of the person seated opposite her: Luis Quizhpi-Tacuri, a
            twenty-four-year-old construction worker and the driver who killed
            her son.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luis seemed to her apathetic as he mumbled answers to the presiding
            judge, who grew irritated at his incomprehensibility. The judge was
            gentler with Amy. She'd once had a run-in with him after a hearing
            to which she'd accompanied another victim's mother. The judge had
            prevented the mother from speaking, and afterward Amy yelled at him
            that protecting a driver from the pain of what he'd done was
            "unconscionable." This time, the judge granted Amy the floor. Doing
            her best to stop her voice from wobbling, she told Luis that she
            understood that he did not intend to kill Sammy, and that she wasn't
            angry anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            After her son died, she had read a draft version of the drash that
            he had been writing for his upcoming bar mitzvah. Through the story
            of the estranged brothers Jacob and Esau, he'd decided to explore
            why he was readier to criticize than to understand. "I find it
            really hard to forgive people," he'd written. "So I decided I would
            look into why that might be." Amy was determined to forgive Luis,
            but, as she told the judge, she didn't want Luis to exit the room
            having faced no consequences for taking Sammy's life. In the end,
            the judge suspended Luis's license for six months.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last month, in the kitchen of a Queens apartment whose bedrooms he
            sublets, Luis told me that, long after he knelt and held Sammy's
            hands while they waited for the ambulance to arrive, he kept seeing
            the boy's face when he rode the subway. "This boy had a future,"
            Luis said. Sirens give him flashbacks of how he took it away. On the
            afternoon of Sammy's death, Luis had been driving down Prospect Park
            West to pick up tools for a job that started early the following
            day. As he approached the intersection, the light turned green and
            he proceeded, thinking little of a small bump he felt until he heard
            pedestrians screaming. "Every time I see an accident nearby or feel
            the car jump, I start to shake," he said, clasping his hands. "I
            feel like crying. I get chills." He hasn't been able to afford a
            therapist. His parents back in Ecuador tell him to forgive himself,
            but had he not started attending church, he thinks, he would never
            have found a way to live with his guilt. Luis was raising three
            children of his own when he hit Sammy. He's waiting until the
            younger ones are a bit older to share the full story of why he gets
            emotional when reminding them to take care on city streets.

            Many drivers summoned to fatality hearings follow their lawyers'
            advice not to express the extent of their shame because apologies
            may be used against them in civil court. Since Amy quit her job and
            started volunteering full time for F.S.S., three years after Sammy's
            death, she has supported restorative-justice practices that would
            bring more honesty and accountability to the post-crash process. But
            she is more drawn to work that keeps people out of fatality hearings
            in the first place. In 1980, Candace Lightner, who lost her daughter
            to a drunk driver, founded Mothers Against Drunk Driving, an
            organization that helped to halve the number of U.S. drunk-driving
            fatalities by the end of the century, in part by leading a fight to
            raise the drinking age and lower the threshold for blood-alcohol
            levels. The madd model reinforces one of Amy's most closely held
            convictions: that improvements the public ascribes to "cultural"
            changes are, more often than not, created by changes in policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Gerritsen Avenue, a broad thoroughfare in southern Brooklyn,
            culture and policy met headlong. Weekend drag races down the avenue
            were a neighborhood tradition, and, from 2009 to 2018, nine people
            died and more than two hundred were injured on the street.
            Nonetheless, the community board representing the surrounding area
            resisted safety remedies that the Department of Transportation
            proposed. New York City's fifty-nine community boards are its most
            local level of government, and, with few exceptions, the D.O.T.
            consults them before starting work on a redesign. Because bike lanes
            and projects that slow down streets or repurpose space reserved for
            cars often come at the cost of free neighborhood parking and a
            community's desire for self-control, resistance is frequent-and
            effective. The D.O.T. overrides community-board objections only a
            handful of times each year.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            In the case of Gerritsen Avenue, it took two grave crashes and a
            civil suit against the city to get a street redesign under way.
            After a driver going more than fifty miles an hour hit and
            permanently disabled a twelve-year-old boy, his family successfully
            sued the city. In 2016, the New York Court of Appeals upheld a jury
            decision finding the city liable for failing to fix a speeding
            problem it had known about for years. That same year, another young
            cyclist was fatally wounded, and the department at last began
            narrowing the street by installing a turning lane and a bike lane.
            As city engineers started work, they found the tires of their
            vehicles slashed. A few months later, D.O.T. construction workers
            who felt threatened by residents had to request security from the
            local precinct. Since the safety redesign was completed, in the fall
            of 2018, there have been no fatalities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonetheless, some of those who live nearby resent the changes to the
            street and complain about city leaders overengineering their
            behavior. This line of argument about local and personal autonomy is
            one that Amy and other F.S.S. members have also heard during a long
            campaign for more automated speed enforcement. The threat of tickets
            from speed cameras has been shown to reduce crashes, and having more
            of them in a city is the sort of policy shift that can change
            entrenched habits. In 2014, when the Department of Transportation
            began camera enforcement in select school zones as part of a pilot
            program that F.S.S. had backed, speeding plummeted by sixty-three
            per cent. Yet drivers dislike being spied on when speeding, and when
            the pilot program ended, in 2018, state politicians declined to
            continue it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Amy was always relentless with legislators, but by that year she had
            learned to stay composed, having put behind her a few episodes in
            Albany in which she had erupted in rage. All the measured
            conversations weren't getting much speed enforcement, however. So,
            on the first day of summer, she, Amy Tam-Liao, and other F.S.S.
            members put on their matching T-shirts, grabbed their signs, and
            made a human chain at rush hour in front of Governor Andrew Cuomo's
            New York City office, upon which some of them were handcuffed and
            jailed for blocking traffic. In August, they protested for nine
            hours at the Bay Ridge office of a state senator who had pulled his
            support. At month's end, Cuomo issued an emergency order to
            reactivate the existing cameras. The following year, he signed a
            bill enabling the city to expand the program to seven hundred and
            fifty school zones.

            Tamar Cohen Eckstein, who graduated from Oberlin College in 2020 and
            is now a preschool teacher, admires her mom's advocacy. But she and
            her father prefer to watch the battles from a distance. "It's hard
            to be so vulnerable with strangers," Tamar said. When Sammy was
            alive, weekends had been for family bike rides and learning to
            ice-skate backward at the rink in Prospect Park, not four-hour bus
            trips upstate to lobby. She's still hurt by a memory of a day when
            she and her mother were snapped at by a hostile legislator. "I don't
            know how my mom does it, frankly," Tamar said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before speaking to the public or lawmakers, F.S.S. members harden
            themselves by reminding one another that they are "putting a face to
            the numbers." Amy said, "Grief experts say you have to let the pain
            out, and I figured that if I'm going to let it out I might as well
            let it go to good use." But, as adept as she has become in front of
            a microphone, an uncertain quality tends to come over her when she's
            asked to speak off script about her son.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although demoralization is constant in this kind of advocacy, she
            and her colleagues-friends now, really-try to buoy themselves by
            remembering that the successes translate to lives saved. One victory
            came after they joined other advocates in an effort to improve
            Queens Boulevard, whose reputation as one of the deadliest streets
            in the U.S. had come up at the very first F.S.S. meeting. Between
            1990 and 2014, a hundred and eighty-five people died on the road,
            among them a young assistant teacher named Asif Rahman. In 2008, he
            was biking to meet his mother, Lizi Rahman, after work when the
            driver of a freight truck ran him over. Afterward, Lizi wrote to
            City Council members, borough officials, and newspaper editors,
            pleading for a bike lane on the boulevard. She made no progress
            until she joined F.S.S. and met people like Mary Beth Kelly, who had
            her own story of fruitless advocacy for bike lanes after her husband
            had been killed. Before long, Lizi was no longer attending Queens
            Boulevard community meetings alone. Beginning in early 2015, Amy,
            Mary Beth, and other F.S.S. members helped Lizi galvanize support
            for a hundred-million-dollar proposal from the D.O.T.: a major
            redesign of the boulevard that included a bike lane.

            The traffic lulls created by the pandemic have inspired local
            governments around the world to reconceive public space and
            reconsider the supremacy of cars. The mayors of London and Paris,
            for instance, dramatically reduced the number of motor vehicles in
            their cities' centers, and many U.S. mayors blocked cars from
            certain streets, giving them over to pedestrians and cyclists. In
            one sign that concern for non-drivers might extend beyond the
            pandemic, the U.S. Department of Transportation recently earmarked
            five billion dollars over the next five years to help states and
            cities redesign dangerous streets.
          </p>
          <p>
            But much of the work ahead will depend on grassroots advocacy, some
            of which will be done by Families for Safe Streets, new chapters of
            which have begun springing up around the country. A chapter in
            Portland, Oregon, has been focussing on state highways, where the
            majority of the region's traffic fatalities occur. Nashville-based
            members are scrutinizing the two per cent of streets where sixty per
            cent of the city's pedestrian injuries and fatalities occur-arterial
            roads with little space for walking. Last year, a chapter in Texas
            successfully lobbied to require drivers to stop, not just yield, for
            pedestrians who are crossing with the right-of-way. Philadelphia's
            chapter helped bring speed cameras to a twelve-lane road where four
            relatives of an F.S.S. member were killed while crossing the street.
            And, in the Bay Area, F.S.S. members helped to persuade the state
            legislature to pass a speed-limit law and keep a portion of Golden
            Gate Park car-free. The chapter's leader, Aly Geller, said of the
            F.S.S. movement in California, "You can't turn away from it as a
            politician anymore." She added, about Amy, "She is a lot of people's
            hero for good reason." Amy tears up when she hears talk of herself
            as a national figure. This year's Seder was the first since Sammy's
            death that she felt like cooking for, a reminder that what she tells
            new members of her group-that the boulder they're carrying may
            lighten a little over time-might actually be true. But, she said, "I
            wish I didn't have to do this."

            Amy is currently campaigning for the passage of the Crash Victim
            Rights and Safety Act, a set of eight bills in the New York State
            legislature that would, among other things, require drivers to leave
            cyclists at least three feet of space when passing them from behind,
            insure that family members of victims are kept better informed by
            the police and D.M.V., and let New York City lower its default speed
            limit to twenty miles an hour. The latter bill is called Sammy's
            Law. After four bills passed in the State Senate last year, the
            Assembly adjourned for the summer before bringing any of them to a
            vote. This session, Amy has been trying to get them across the
            finish line, securing the endorsement of more than a hundred
            organizations, including hospitals and environmental-justice groups.

            Last month, she, Amy Tam-Liao, and two dozen other F.S.S. members
            took a bus to Albany to find additional allies at an annual
            conference led by state legislators of color. At the capitol that
            Saturday afternoon, Amy and her colleagues converged with other
            F.S.S. members from around the state in a brightly lit exhibit hall
            where hundreds of activists, union officials, corporate executives,
            and state bureaucrats set out brochures on folding tables and
            prepared to expound on the urgency of their particular cause. As
            veteran F.S.S. members spread out in search of support for the
            street-safety bills, they were trailed by new F.S.S. members, trying
            to learn.

            In a din of overlapping voices, Amy approached a peppy woman from
            the Assembly speaker's office and began her pitch. "My name is Amy
            Cohen, and my twelve-year-old son was killed eight years ago in a
            car crash." She held up the photograph of Sammy that she has brought
            to rallies, vigils, and meetings for these past eight years: dark
            hair just long enough to curl at the ends, braces he'd looked
            forward to getting rid of. It was taken a few days before he died.
            As she asked for the speaker's support, the smile on the staffer's
            face faded, and Amy's peers grew still, allowing themselves to be
            observed. On the ride back to New York City, some of them were so
            drained that they slept.

            Rentering the city, the bus driver let off a couple of people at
            178th Street and Park Avenue in the Bronx, where, in the surrounding
            three blocks, forty-two crashes have left one person dead and
            sixty-three people injured in the past year. It was dark by the time
            the driver opened the doors at the final stop, Grand Central
            Station, where, in the surrounding three blocks, fifteen recent
            crashes have left one person dead and nineteen people injured. The
            members grabbed their backpacks, gathered up half-empty bags of
            chips and some clementine peels to use as compost, and alighted into
            a blare of car horns and the blithe clamor of a midtown Saturday
            night. They would reconvene at the station a few weeks later to
            embark on another day of lobbying in Albany. See you soon, they told
            one another, before taking the photos of their loved ones back home.
